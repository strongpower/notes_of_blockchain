Some notes of learning blockchain.

1. How does a blockchain organize code? in other words: a block chain resp contains which models?
* maybe network model, such as p2p or normal http and so on.
* maybe data storage, such as leveldb in Bitcoin, or memory cache in EOS.
* maybe consensus algorithms, such as POW, POS, DPOS, PBFT, Raft and so on. 
* maybe data serializer, such as protobuf in Bitcoin, boost serializer in EOS.
* maybe message queue, such as ZeroMQ in Bitcoin.

2. What's in common between these blockchain projects?
